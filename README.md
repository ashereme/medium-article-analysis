# medium-article-analysis

Medium is an online publishing platform where writers ranging from amateurs to professionals are able to publish their unique content. A diverse group of writers brings in articles of all lengths. I’ve created a Python script utilizing the NLTK library to analyze Medium articles displaying most frequently used stop words, nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

<b>How is this helpful?</b>

This script will be useful for both reader and writer. As a reader, you can infer the plot of the article and if it sparks your interest just from the wordage. For the writer, it’s a good way to learn about your writing style and how you can make improvements.

<b>How to use it?</b>

Simply compile the Python script and provide a medium article URL:

`python script.py https://medium.com/@jalajpunn/the-start-of-new-chapter-57488c7d11aa`

And watch the NLTK library analyze the article!
